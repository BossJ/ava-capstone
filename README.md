## Overview
Ava is a chatbot designed to facilitate and continually improve Avanade’s online customer service. Avanade has partnered with the iSchool to develop a solution that will align with their new marketing platform. Avanade‘s vision of the future revolves around artificial intelligence, and Ava is a step in that direction. Ava consolodates the most important information about Avanade in one location for all people who visit the website. Ava will be consistently improving answers with better matches and new questions. With the dawn of AI on the horizon, integrating new ways for humans to interact, experience, and use technology are becoming the norm. Artificial intelligence is real, it’s driving business results, and will be a first-class citizen in the enterprise by 2020.

### Technologies Used
* Microsoft Bot Framework
    * The Bot Framework is a very new framework that already has a lot of functionality. It is also constantly adding and improving features that can be integrated, offering more functionality as time goes on. The Bot Framework already has the ability to connect to many different channels like Skype, Bing, Slack, Twilio, GroupMe, Cortana, Kik, Facebook Messenger, and much more.
* Microsoft QnA Maker
    * Microsoft's QnA Maker allows us to connect knowledge databases that Ava can use when communicating with a website visitor. Here, we can add question and answere pairs, improve answers, and add new questions/answers from previous conversations.
* Microsoft Azure
    * Microsoft Azure handles all of our back-end details to actually run Ava. Here, we can also retrieve logs about separate conversations, unanswered questions, and confusion when visitors use Ava.
* Microsoft LUIS
    * The Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) allows Ava to continually make smarter choices by analyzing the intent of the words & sentences a visitor inputs into the conversation. LUIS also allows the administrator to develop custom knowledge bases that specifically cater to whatever culture is within the company.
* Node.js
    * Node.js is easily compatible with Microsoft's Bot Framework, so the documentation was very helpful in figuring out our first steps with Ava. Luckily, Avanade also supports and can work around with Node on their back-end. Node.js is optimal for real-time applications and takes almost no system resources when dealing with many clients, which is perfect for browser-based chat applications - like Ava.
